<p align="center">Choose and use passwords wisely – Make certain that your password contains at least 8 characters and includes a variety of numbers, letters, and/or symbols.
<hr width="100%" color="green" size ="20">
Download with care – Download images, applications, and screen savers from trusted sources only. Make certain that you know that the website you are visiting and it is one you can trust.
<hr width="100%" color="green" size ="20">
Do not immediately open e-mail attachments – If you receive an e-mail attachment that you were not expecting (even if it is from someone you know), do not open it—there may be a virus contained within it. Your best bet is to send e-mail back to the sender asking them to explain what the attachment contains. If it is a virus, they may not even know the e-mail was sent. This extra step can really help to protect your system!
<hr width="100%" color="green" size ="20">
Avoid forwarding chain letters, jokes, and other types of SPAM – These letters often contain false information that misleads people. In addition, they send the personal data of yourself and your friends to strangers through malware embedded in the chain-email.  By forwarding emails to your friends, you may be creating a list of emails for spammer to use.

<hr width="100%" color="green" size ="20">
