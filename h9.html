<p align="center">ClickJacking is also known by a different name, UI Redress. In this attack, 
the hacker hides the actual UI where the victim is supposed to click. This behaviour is very common in app download, 
movie streaming, and torrent websites. While they mostly employ this technique to earn advertising dollars, 
others can use it to steal your personal information.

In another word, in this type of hacking, the attacker hijacks the clicks of the victim that arenâ€™t meant for the exact page, 
but for a page where the hacker wants you to be. It works by fooling an internet user into performing an undesired action by clicking on hidden link.
