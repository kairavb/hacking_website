<p align="center">Unlike other attacks which are active in nature, using a passive attack, 
a hacker just monitors the computer systems and networks to gain some unwanted information.

The motive behind eavesdropping is not to harm the system but to get some information without being identified. 
These types of hackers can target email, instant messaging services, phone calls, web browsing, 
and other methods of communication. Those who indulge in such activities are generally black hat hackers, government agencies, etc.
