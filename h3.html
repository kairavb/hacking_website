<p align="center">A Denial of Service attack is a hacking technique to take down a site or server by 
flooding that site or server with a lot of traffic that the server is unable to process all the requests in
the real time and finally crashes down. This popular technique, the attacker floods the targeted machine with 
tons of requests to overwhelm the resources, which, in turn, restrict the actual requests from being fulfilled.

For DDoS attacks, hackers often deploy botnets or zombie computers which have got the only work to flood your system with request packets.
With each passing year, as the malware and types of hackers keep getting advanced, the size of DDoS attacks keeps getting increasing.</p>
