<p align="center">Using bait and switch hacking technique, an attacker can buy advertising spaces on the websites. 
Later, when a user clicks on the ad, he might get directed to a page that’s infected with malware. This way, 
they can further install malware or adware on your computer. The ads and download links shown in this technique are 
very attractive and users are expected to end up clicking on the same.
 
The hacker can run a malicious program which the user believes to be authentic. This way, after installing the malicious program on your computer, 
the hacker gets unprivileged access to your computer.

In near future, we’re going to publish a list of different types of hackers, so stay tuned for more interesting information and hacking.
