<p align="center">Keylogger is a simple software that records the key sequence and strokes of your keyboard into a log file on your machine. 
These log files might even contain your personal email IDs and passwords.
 Also known as keyboard capturing, it can be either software or hardware.
 While software-based keyloggers target the programs installed on a computer, 
 hardware devices target keyboards, electromagnetic emissions, smartphone sensors, etc.

Keylogger is one of the main reasons why online banking sites give you an option to use their virtual keyboards.
 So, whenever youâ€™re operating a computer in public setting, try to take extra caution.</P>
