<p align="center">Phishing is a hacking technique using which a hacker replicates the most-accessed 
sites and traps the victim by sending that spoofed link. Combined with social engineering, 
it becomes one of the most commonly used and deadliest attack vectors.

Once the victim tries to login or enters some data, the hacker gets that private information of the 
target victim using the trojan running on the fake site. Phishing via iCloud and Gmail account was the 
attack route taken by hackers who targeted the “Fappening” leak, which involved numerous Hollywood female celebrities.
