<p align="center">If you are a big fan of Discovery or National Geographic channels, 
you could relate easily with the waterhole attacks. To poison a place, in this case, 
the hacker hits the most accessible physical point of the victim.
For example, if the source of a river is poisoned, it will hit the entire stretch of animals during summer. 
In the same way, hackers target the most accessed physical location to attack the victim. That point could be a coffee shop, a cafeteria, etc.

Once hackers are aware of your timings, using this type of hacking, they might create a fake Wi-Fi 
access point and modify your most visited website to redirect them to you to get your personal information. 
As this attack collects information on a user from a specific place, detecting the attacker is even harder. 
One of the best ways to protect yourself again such types of hacking attacks is to follow basic security practices and keep your software/OS updated.
