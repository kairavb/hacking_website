# hacking_website
an old website to learn about ethical hacking and tinker with few tools

// intro  
i made this when i was 13 years old (2017)  
this was my first website, made for school competittion, got 1st prize there!!  
i continued to upgrade the project months after competition, so the final version differs with the orignal by little  
at that time i was very much intrested in the field of cyber security, wanted to become ethcial hacker  
now i am shifting to github, so uploading it here to preserve this very old project  
only made changes that are absolutly required for running this project without errors  

// how to run  
git clone (this repo link)  
open hacking.html (homepage) in any browser  

// external sources  
this website uses 3rd party game which i used to play, dont know from where i get the ".exe" file  
this website contains a video of @TopTrending on YT
