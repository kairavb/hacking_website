<ul>
<li> White Hat </li>
<p align="left">White Hat hackers are also known as ethical hackers, and they’re the good guys of the hacker world. They help you remove viruses, perform pen tests and generally help people understand where their vulnerabilities are and fix them. Most White Hat hackers will hold some form of computer or security related qualification, and often pursue careers in hacking and cyber security. They love the challenge of finding the holes but have no interest in doing anything with them. There are even a number of qualifications specifically for them – Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), CREST Certified Infrastructure Tester and CREST Certified Application Security Tester.  </p>
<li> Black Hat </li>
<p align="center">Black Hat hackers, or ‘crackers’ are the types of people you often hear about on the news and from businesses trying to sell cyber services. They find banks and big companies with weak security systems and steal credit card information, confidential data or money. Their methods are varied but actually fairly basic most of the time.  </p>
<li> Grey Hat </li>
<p align="left">As with everything in this world, nothing is just black and white. Grey Hat hackers don’t steal information or money like Black Hat hackers (though they may sometimes deface a website for fun), nor do they help people out like white hack hackers. Instead, they spend most of their time just playing around with systems, without doing anything harmful. This type of hacker actually makes up most of the hacking community, even though Black hat hackers garner most of the media’s attention. </p>
