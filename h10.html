<p align="center">The cookies of a browser keep our personal data such as browsing history, username, 
and passwords for different sites that we access. Once the hacker gets the access to your cookie, 
he can even authenticate himself as you on a browser. A popular method to carry out this attack is to 
encourage a user’s IP packets to pass through attacker’s machine.

Also known as SideJacking or Session Hijacking, this attack is easy to carry out if the user is not using SSL (https) 
for the complete session. On the websites where you enter your password and banking details, it’s of utmost importance 
for them to make their connections encrypted.
