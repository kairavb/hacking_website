<p align="center">Even just for fun, a hacker can use software to fake a wireless access point. 
This WAP connects to the official public place WAP. Once you get connected the fake WAP, a hacker 
can access your data, just like in the above case.

It’s one of the easier hacks to accomplish and one just needs a simple software and wireless network. 
Anyone can name their WAP as some legit name like “Heathrow Airport WiFi” or “Starbucks WiFi” and start spying on you. 
One of the best ways to protect yourself from such attacks is using a quality VPN service.
